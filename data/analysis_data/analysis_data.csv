BRETTON.,1,0,1
My godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of,1,5,14
"Bretton. Her husband’s family had been residents there for generations,",1,4,11
"and bore, indeed, the name of their birthplace—Bretton of Bretton:",1,3,11
"whether by coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a",1,4,11
personage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his,1,4,10
"neighbourhood, I know not.",1,0,4
"When I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a year, and well I",1,6,16
liked the visit. The house and its inmates specially suited me. The,1,3,12
"large peaceful rooms, the well-arranged furniture, the clear wide",1,5,10
PAULINA.,2,2,1
"Some days elapsed, and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a",2,8,15
fancy to anybody in the house. She was not exactly naughty or wilful:,2,5,13
she was far from disobedient; but an object less conducive to,2,3,11
"comfort—to tranquillity even—than she presented, it was scarcely",2,4,10
possible to have before one’s eyes. She moped: no grown person could,2,1,13
have performed that uncheering business better; no furrowed face of,2,3,10
"adult exile, longing for Europe at Europe’s antipodes, ever bore more",2,3,12
legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant visage. She,2,3,12
"seemed growing old and unearthly. I, Lucy Snowe, plead guiltless of",2,3,11
THE PLAYMATES.,3,2,2
Mr. Home stayed two days. During his visit he could not be prevailed on,3,3,14
"to go out: he sat all day long by the fireside, sometimes silent,",3,3,13
"sometimes receiving and answering Mrs. Bretton’s chat, which was just",3,4,11
"of the proper sort for a man in his morbid mood—not over-sympathetic,",3,3,14
"yet not too uncongenial, sensible; and even with a touch of the",3,3,12
motherly—she was sufficiently his senior to be permitted this touch.,3,1,11
"As to Paulina, the child was at once happy and mute, busy and watchful.",3,9,14
Her father frequently lifted her to his knee; she would sit there till,3,1,13
"she felt or fancied he grew restless; then it was—“Papa, put me down; I",3,4,15
MISS MARCHMONT.,4,1,2
"On quitting Bretton, which I did a few weeks after Paulina’s",4,4,12
departure—little thinking then I was never again to visit it; never,4,4,12
"more to tread its calm old streets—I betook myself home, having been",4,3,13
absent six months. It will be conjectured that I was of course glad to,4,4,14
return to the bosom of my kindred. Well! the amiable conjecture does no,4,2,13
"harm, and may therefore be safely left uncontradicted. Far from saying",4,7,11
"nay, indeed, I will permit the reader to picture me, for the next eight",4,2,14
"years, as a bark slumbering through halcyon weather, in a harbour still",4,8,12
"as glass—the steersman stretched on the little deck, his face up to",4,4,13
TURNING A NEW LEAF.,5,2,4
"My mistress being dead, and I once more alone, I had to look out for a",5,5,16
new place. About this time I might be a little—a very little—shaken in,5,5,15
"nerves. I grant I was not looking well, but, on the contrary, thin,",5,3,13
"haggard, and hollow-eyed; like a sitter-up at night, like an",5,6,12
"overwrought servant, or a placeless person in debt. In debt, however, I",5,3,12
was not; nor quite poor; for though Miss Marchmont had not had time to,5,4,14
"benefit me, as, on that last night, she said she intended, yet, after",5,5,13
"the funeral, my wages were duly paid by her second cousin, the heir, an",5,4,14
"avaricious-looking man, with pinched nose and narrow temples, who,",5,5,10
LONDON.,6,0,1
"The next day was the first of March, and when I awoke, rose, and opened",6,6,15
"my curtain, I saw the risen sun struggling through fog. Above my head,",6,4,13
"above the house-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds, I saw a",6,5,13
"solemn, orbed mass, dark blue and dim—THE DOME. While I looked, my",6,3,13
inner self moved; my spirit shook its always-fettered wings half loose;,6,3,12
"I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet truly lived, were at last",6,5,16
about to taste life. In that morning my soul grew as fast as Jonah’s,6,7,15
gourd.,6,0,1
"“I did well to come,” I said, proceeding to dress with speed and care.",6,3,14
VILLETTE.,7,0,1
I awoke next morning with courage revived and spirits refreshed:,7,3,10
physical debility no longer enervated my judgment; my mind felt prompt,7,2,11
and clear.,7,2,2
"Just as I finished dressing, a tap came to the door: I said, “Come in,”",7,5,15
"expecting the chambermaid, whereas a rough man walked in and said,—",7,8,11
"“Gif me your keys, Meess.”",7,0,5
“Why?” I asked.,7,1,3
"“Gif!” said he impatiently; and as he half-snatched them from my hand,",7,7,13
"he added, “All right! haf your tronc soon.”",7,3,8
MADAME BECK.,8,2,2
"Being delivered into the charge of the maîtresse, I was led through a",8,4,13
"long narrow passage into a foreign kitchen, very clean but very",8,5,11
strange. It seemed to contain no means of cooking—neither fireplace nor,8,4,12
oven; I did not understand that the great black furnace which filled,8,5,12
"one corner, was an efficient substitute for these. Surely pride was not",8,3,12
already beginning its whispers in my heart; yet I felt a sense of,8,4,13
"relief when, instead of being left in the kitchen, as I half",8,3,12
"anticipated, I was led forward to a small inner room termed a",8,7,12
"“cabinet.” A cook in a jacket, a short petticoat and sabots, brought my",8,8,13
ISIDORE.,9,0,1
My time was now well and profitably filled up. What with teaching,9,5,12
"others and studying closely myself, I had hardly a spare moment. It was",9,6,13
pleasant. I felt I was getting on; not lying the stagnant prey of,9,5,13
"mould and rust, but polishing my faculties and whetting them to a keen",9,4,13
"edge with constant use. Experience of a certain kind lay before me, on",9,4,13
"no narrow scale. Villette is a cosmopolitan city, and in this school",9,5,12
"were girls of almost every European nation, and likewise of very varied",9,5,12
rank in life. Equality is much practised in Labassecour; though not,9,5,11
"republican in form, it is nearly so in substance, and at the desks of",9,5,14
DR JOHN.,10,0,2
Madame Beck was a most consistent character; forbearing with all the,10,8,11
"world, and tender to no part of it. Her own children drew her into no",10,2,15
deviation from the even tenor of her stoic calm. She was solicitous,10,3,12
"about her family, vigilant for their interests and physical well-being;",10,5,11
but she never seemed to know the wish to take her little children upon,10,1,14
"her lap, to press their rosy lips with her own, to gather them in a",10,3,15
"genial embrace, to shower on them softly the benignant caress, the",10,4,11
loving word.,10,0,2
"I have watched her sometimes sitting in the garden, viewing the little",10,3,12
THE PORTRESS’S CABINET.,11,1,4
"It was summer and very hot. Georgette, the youngest of Madame Beck’s",11,4,13
"children, took a fever. Désirée, suddenly cured of her ailments, was,",11,3,11
"together with Fifine, packed off to Bonne-Maman, in the country, by way",11,4,13
"of precaution against infection. Medical aid was now really needed, and",11,8,11
"Madame, choosing to ignore the return of Dr. Pillule, who had been at",11,4,13
"home a week, conjured his English rival to continue his visits. One or",11,2,13
"two of the pensionnaires complained of headache, and in other respects",11,5,11
"seemed slightly to participate in Georgette’s ailment. “Now, at last,”",11,5,11
"I thought, “Dr. Pillule must be recalled: the prudent directress will",11,1,11
THE CASKET.,12,1,2
"Behind the house at the Rue Fossette there was a garden—large,",12,5,12
"considering that it lay in the heart of a city, and to my recollection",12,5,14
"at this day it seems pleasant: but time, like distance, lends to",12,5,12
certain scenes an influence so softening; and where all is stone,12,4,11
"around, blank wall and hot pavement, how precious seems one shrub, how",12,5,12
lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground!,12,3,8
There went a tradition that Madame Beck’s house had in old days been a,12,8,15
"convent. That in years gone by—how long gone by I cannot tell, but I",12,3,15
"think some centuries—before the city had over-spread this quarter, and",12,4,12
A SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON.,13,2,5
"I had occasion to smile—nay, to laugh, at Madame again, within the",13,9,13
space of four and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in the,13,4,14
last chapter.,13,2,2
"Villette owns a climate as variable, though not so humid, as that of",13,7,13
"any English town. A night of high wind followed upon that soft sunset,",13,3,13
"and all the next day was one of dry storm—dark, beclouded, yet",13,5,13
"rainless,—the streets were dim with sand and dust, whirled from the",13,3,12
boulevards. I know not that even lovely weather would have tempted me,13,4,12
to spend the evening-time of study and recreation where I had spent it,13,3,14
THE FÊTE.,14,0,2
"As soon as Georgette was well, Madame sent her away into the country. I",14,7,14
"was sorry; I loved the child, and her loss made me poorer than before.",14,4,14
But I must not complain. I lived in a house full of robust life; I,14,2,15
"might have had companions, and I chose solitude. Each of the teachers",14,6,12
in turn made me overtures of special intimacy; I tried them all. One I,14,4,14
"found to be an honest woman, but a narrow thinker, a coarse feeler, and",14,7,14
"an egotist. The second was a Parisienne, externally refined—at heart,",14,7,11
"corrupt—without a creed, without a principle, without an affection:",14,4,10
"having penetrated the outward crust of decorum in this character, you",14,5,11
THE LONG VACATION.,15,2,3
"Following Madame Beck’s fête, with its three preceding weeks of",15,2,11
"relaxation, its brief twelve hours’ burst of hilarity and dissipation,",15,5,10
"and its one subsequent day of utter languor, came a period of reaction;",15,6,13
"two months of real application, of close, hard study. These two months,",15,4,12
"being the last of the “année scolaire,” were indeed the only genuine",15,3,12
working months in the year. To them was procrastinated—into them,15,4,11
"concentrated, alike by professors, mistresses, and pupils—the main",15,4,9
burden of preparation for the examinations preceding the distribution,15,4,9
of prizes. Candidates for rewards had then to work in good earnest;,15,5,12
AULD LANG SYNE.,16,2,3
"Where my soul went during that swoon I cannot tell. Whatever she saw,",16,4,13
or wherever she travelled in her trance on that strange night she kept,16,4,13
"her own secret; never whispering a word to Memory, and baffling",16,3,11
"imagination by an indissoluble silence. She may have gone upward, and",16,7,11
"come in sight of her eternal home, hoping for leave to rest now, and",16,3,14
deeming that her painful union with matter was at last dissolved. While,16,6,12
"she so deemed, an angel may have warned her away from heaven’s",16,8,13
"threshold, and, guiding her weeping down, have bound her, once more,",16,2,11
"all shuddering and unwilling, to that poor frame, cold and wasted, of",16,6,12
LA TERRASSE.,17,2,2
"These struggles with the natural character, the strong native bent of",17,5,11
"the heart, may seem futile and fruitless, but in the end they do good.",17,3,14
"They tend, however slightly, to give the actions, the conduct, that",17,2,11
"turn which Reason approves, and which Feeling, perhaps, too often",17,4,10
opposes: they certainly make a difference in the general tenour of a,17,5,12
"life, and enable it to be better regulated, more equable, quieter on",17,4,12
the surface; and it is on the surface only the common gaze will fall.,17,5,14
"As to what lies below, leave that with God. Man, your equal, weak as",17,8,14
"you, and not fit to be your judge, may be shut out thence: take it to",17,3,16
WE QUARREL.,18,1,2
"During the first days of my stay at the Terrace, Graham never took a",18,7,14
"seat near me, or in his frequent pacing of the room approached the",18,5,13
"quarter where I sat, or looked pre-occupied, or more grave than usual,",18,5,13
but I thought of Miss Fanshawe and expected her name to leap from his,18,5,14
lips. I kept my ear and mind in perpetual readiness for the tender,18,4,13
"theme; my patience was ordered to be permanently under arms, and my",18,5,12
sympathy desired to keep its cornucopia replenished and ready for,18,4,10
"outpouring. At last, and after a little inward struggle, which I saw",18,7,12
"and respected, he one day launched into the topic. It was introduced",18,4,12
THE CLEOPATRA.,19,2,2
My stay at La Terrasse was prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of,19,6,13
the vacation. Mrs. Bretton’s kind management procured me this respite.,19,4,11
Her son having one day delivered the dictum that “Lucy was not yet,19,4,13
"strong enough to go back to that den of a pensionnat,” she at once",19,5,14
"drove over to the Rue Fossette, had an interview with the directress,",19,2,12
"and procured the indulgence, on the plea of prolonged rest and change",19,4,12
"being necessary to perfect recovery. Hereupon, however, followed an",19,2,9
"attention I could very well have dispensed with, viz.—a polite call",19,4,12
from Madame Beck.,19,2,3
THE CONCERT.,20,0,2
"One morning, Mrs. Bretton, coming promptly into my room, desired me to",20,0,12
"open my drawers and show her my dresses; which I did, without a word.",20,3,14
"“That will do,” said she, when she had turned them over. “You must have",20,4,14
a new one.”,20,1,3
She went out. She returned presently with a dressmaker. She had me,20,3,12
"measured. “I mean,” said she, “to follow my own taste, and to have my",20,6,14
own way in this little matter.”,20,2,6
Two days after came home—a pink dress!,20,4,8
"“That is not for me,” I said, hurriedly, feeling that I would almost as",20,5,14
REACTION.,21,1,1
"Yet three days, and then I must go back to the _pensionnat_. I almost",21,5,14
numbered the moments of these days upon the clock; fain would I have,21,3,13
retarded their flight; but they glided by while I watched them: they,21,2,12
were already gone while I yet feared their departure.,21,4,9
"“Lucy will not leave us to-day,” said Mrs. Bretton, coaxingly at",21,5,12
breakfast; “she knows we can procure a second respite.”,21,4,9
"“I would not ask for one if I might have it for a word,” said I. “I",21,4,17
"long to get the good-by over, and to be settled in the Rue Fossette",21,1,15
again. I must go this morning: I must go directly; my trunk is packed,21,3,14
THE LETTER.,22,0,2
When all was still in the house; when dinner was over and the noisy,22,4,14
"recreation-hour past; when darkness had set in, and the quiet lamp of",22,6,13
"study was lit in the refectory; when the externes were gone home, the",22,1,13
clashing door and clamorous bell hushed for the evening; when Madame,22,5,11
was safely settled in the salle-à-manger in company with her mother and,22,6,14
"some friends; I then glided to the kitchen, begged a bougie for one",22,1,13
"half-hour for a particular occasion, found acceptance of my petition at",22,8,12
"the hands of my friend Goton, who answered, “Mais certainement,",22,4,10
"chou-chou, vous en aurez deux, si vous voulez;” and, light in hand, I",22,3,14
VASHTI.,23,1,1
"To wonder sadly, did I say? No: a new influence began to act upon my",23,5,15
"life, and sadness, for a certain space, was held at bay. Conceive a",23,9,13
"dell, deep-hollowed in forest secresy; it lies in dimness and mist: its",23,1,13
"turf is dank, its herbage pale and humid. A storm or an axe makes a",23,9,15
wide gap amongst the oak-trees; the breeze sweeps in; the sun looks,23,3,13
"down; the sad, cold dell becomes a deep cup of lustre; high summer",23,2,13
"pours her blue glory and her golden light out of that beauteous sky,",23,3,13
which till now the starved hollow never saw.,23,2,8
A new creed became mine—a belief in happiness.,23,4,9
M. DE BASSOMPIERRE.,24,1,3
"Those who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the",24,3,11
"seclusion of schools or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are",24,4,12
liable to be suddenly and for a long while dropped out of the memory of,24,3,15
"their friends, the denizens of a freer world. Unaccountably, perhaps,",24,4,10
and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercourse—some,24,3,10
"congeries of rather exciting little circumstances, whose natural sequel",24,4,9
would rather seem to be the quickening than the suspension of,24,2,11
"communication—there falls a stilly pause, a wordless silence, a long",24,6,11
blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire and,24,6,11
THE LITTLE COUNTESS.,25,0,3
"Cheerful as my godmother naturally was, and entertaining as, for our",25,7,11
"sakes, she made a point of being, there was no true enjoyment that",25,5,13
"evening at La Terrasse, till, through the wild howl of the",25,3,11
"winter-night, were heard the signal sounds of arrival. How often, while",25,4,12
"women and girls sit warm at snug fire-sides, their hearts and",25,5,12
imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding their,25,3,10
"persons, forced out by night to wander through dark ways, to dare",25,4,12
"stress of weather, to contend with the snow-blast, to wait at lonely",25,4,13
"gates and stiles in wildest storms, watching and listening to see and",25,5,12
A BURIAL.,26,2,2
"From this date my life did not want variety; I went out a good deal,",26,5,15
"with the entire consent of Madame Beck, who perfectly approved the",26,3,11
grade of my acquaintance. That worthy directress had never from the,26,6,11
first treated me otherwise than with respect; and when she found that I,26,4,13
"was liable to frequent invitations from a château and a great hotel,",26,8,12
respect improved into distinction.,26,0,4
"Not that she was fulsome about it: Madame, in all things worldly, was",26,7,13
in nothing weak; there was measure and sense in her hottest pursuit of,26,4,13
"self-interest, calm and considerateness in her closest clutch of gain;",26,4,11
THE HÔTEL CRÉCY.,27,0,3
"The morrow turned out a more lively and busy day than we—or than I, at",27,6,16
least—had anticipated. It seems it was the birthday of one of the young,27,6,14
"princes of Labassecour—the eldest, I think, the Duc de Dindonneau, and",27,4,12
"a general holiday was given in his honour at the schools, and",27,6,12
"especially at the principal “Athénée,” or college. The youth of that",27,5,11
"institution had also concocted, and were to present a loyal address;",27,6,11
for which purpose they were to be assembled in the public building,27,1,12
"where the yearly examinations were conducted, and the prizes",27,4,9
"distributed. After the ceremony of presentation, an oration, or",27,4,9
THE WATCHGUARD.,28,2,2
M. Paul Emanuel owned an acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of,28,6,11
"interruption, from whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: to",28,2,9
pass through the classe under such circumstances was considered by the,28,4,11
"teachers and pupils of the school, individually and collectively, to be",28,4,11
as much as a woman’s or girl’s life was worth.,28,5,12
"Madame Beck herself, if forced to the enterprise, would “skurry”",28,2,10
"through, retrenching her skirts, and carefully coasting the formidable",28,4,9
"estrade, like a ship dreading breakers. As to Rosine, the portress—on",28,5,12
"whom, every half-hour, devolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out",28,2,12
MONSIEUR’S FÊTE.,29,0,3
"I was up the next morning an hour before daybreak, and finished my",29,5,13
"guard, kneeling on the dormitory floor beside the centre stand, for the",29,2,12
benefit of such expiring glimmer as the night-lamp afforded in its last,29,4,13
watch.,29,1,1
All my materials—my whole stock of beads and silk—were used up before,29,5,14
the chain assumed the length and richness I wished; I had wrought it,29,4,13
"double, as I knew, by the rule of contraries, that to, suit the",29,3,13
"particular taste whose gratification was in view, an effective",29,7,9
"appearance was quite indispensable. As a finish to the ornament, a",29,9,11
M. PAUL.,30,1,2
Yet the reader is advised not to be in any hurry with his kindly,30,3,14
"conclusions, or to suppose, with an over-hasty charity, that from that",30,5,12
"day M. Paul became a changed character—easy to live with, and no longer",30,9,14
apt to flash danger and discomfort round him.,30,4,8
No; he was naturally a little man of unreasonable moods. When,30,7,11
"over-wrought, which he often was, he became acutely irritable; and,",30,5,11
"besides, his veins were dark with a livid belladonna tincture, the",30,4,11
essence of jealousy. I do not mean merely the tender jealousy of the,30,3,13
"heart, but that sterner, narrower sentiment whose seat is in the head.",30,5,12
THE DRYAD.,31,1,2
"The spring was advancing, and the weather had turned suddenly warm.",31,7,11
"This change of temperature brought with it for me, as probably for many",31,5,13
"others, temporary decrease of strength. Slight exertion at this time",31,3,10
left me overcome with fatigue—sleepless nights entailed languid days.,31,4,10
"One Sunday afternoon, having walked the distance of half a league to",31,8,12
"the Protestant church, I came back weary and exhausted; and taking",31,8,11
"refuge in my solitary sanctuary, the first classe, I was glad to sit",31,6,13
"down, and to make of my desk a pillow for my arms and head.",31,6,14
"Awhile I listened to the lullaby of bees humming in the berceau, and",31,4,13
THE FIRST LETTER.,32,0,3
"Where, it becomes time to inquire, was Paulina Mary? How fared my",32,5,12
"intercourse with the sumptuous Hôtel Crécy? That intercourse had, for",32,2,10
"an interval, been suspended by absence; M. and Miss de Bassompierre had",32,6,12
"been travelling, dividing some weeks between the provinces and capital",32,4,10
of France. Chance apprised me of their return very shortly after it,32,4,12
took place.,32,1,2
"I was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard, wandering slowly",32,6,12
"on, enjoying the benign April sun, and some thoughts not unpleasing,",32,3,11
"when I saw before me a group of riders, stopping as if they had just",32,4,15
M. PAUL KEEPS HIS PROMISE.,33,1,5
"On the first of May, we had all—i.e. the twenty boarders and the four",33,5,16
"teachers—notice to rise at five o’clock of the morning, to be dressed",33,2,14
"and ready by six, to put ourselves under the command of M. le",33,3,13
"Professeur Emanuel, who was to head our march forth from Villette, for",33,4,12
it was on this day he proposed to fulfil his promise of taking us to,33,3,15
"breakfast in the country. I, indeed, as the reader may perhaps",33,6,11
"remember, had not had the honour of an invitation when this excursion",33,4,12
was first projected—rather the contrary; but on my now making allusion,33,5,12
"to this fact, and wishing to know how it was to be, my ear received a",33,5,16
MALEVOLA.,34,2,1
"Madame Beck called me on Thursday afternoon, and asked whether I had",34,8,12
any occupation to hinder me from going into town and executing some,34,3,12
little commissions for her at the shops.,34,1,7
"Being disengaged, and placing myself at her service, I was presently",34,5,11
"furnished with a list of the wools, silks, embroidering thread,",34,2,10
"etcetera, wanted in the pupils’ work, and having equipped myself in a",34,5,12
"manner suiting the threatening aspect of a cloudy and sultry day, I was",34,7,13
"just drawing the spring-bolt of the street-door, in act to issue forth,",34,2,14
when Madame’s voice again summoned me to the salle-à-manger.,34,6,12
FRATERNITY.,35,1,1
“Oubliez les Professeurs.” So said Madame Beck. Madame Beck was a wise,35,7,12
"woman, but she should not have uttered those words. To do so was a",35,4,14
"mistake. That night she should have left me calm—not excited,",35,4,11
"indifferent, not interested, isolated in my own estimation and that of",35,4,11
"others—not connected, even in idea, with this second person whom I was",35,2,13
to forget.,35,0,2
Forget him? Ah! they took a sage plan to make me forget him—the,35,5,14
wiseheads! They showed me how good he was; they made of my dear little,35,4,14
man a stainless little hero. And then they had prated about his manner,35,8,13
THE APPLE OF DISCORD.,36,1,4
"Besides Fifine Beck’s mother, another power had a word to say to M.",36,4,14
"Paul and me, before that covenant of friendship could be ratified. We",36,5,12
were under the surveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously,36,4,11
"her son through that mystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to",36,5,14
which M. Emanuel drew nigh month by month—the sliding panel of the,36,2,13
confessional.,36,1,1
“Why were you so glad to be friends with M. Paul?” asks the reader.,36,4,14
“Had he not long been a friend to you? Had he not given proof on proof,36,3,16
of a certain partiality in his feelings?”,36,4,7
SUNSHINE.,37,0,1
It was very well for Paulina to decline further correspondence with,37,3,11
Graham till her father had sanctioned the intercourse. But Dr. Bretton,37,5,11
"could not live within a league of the Hôtel Crécy, and not contrive to",37,3,14
"visit there often. Both lovers meant at first, I believe, to be",37,2,12
distant; they kept their intention so far as demonstrative courtship,37,4,10
"went, but in feeling they soon drew very near.",37,1,9
"All that was best in Graham sought Paulina; whatever in him was noble,",37,9,13
"awoke, and grew in her presence. With his past admiration of Miss",37,5,12
"Fanshawe, I suppose his intellect had little to do, but his whole",37,3,12
CLOUD.,38,0,1
"But it is not so for all. What then? His will be done, as done it",38,3,16
"surely will be, whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not. The",38,1,12
"impulse of creation forwards it; the strength of powers, seen and",38,3,11
"unseen, has its fulfilment in charge. Proof of a life to come must be",38,3,14
"given. In fire and in blood, if needful, must that proof be written. In",38,2,14
fire and in blood do we trace the record throughout nature. In fire and,38,4,14
"in blood does it cross our own experience. Sufferer, faint not through",38,1,12
"terror of this burning evidence. Tired wayfarer, gird up thy loins;",38,2,11
"look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother mourners, join in",38,4,10
OLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE.,39,4,4
"Fascinated as by a basilisk with three heads, I could not leave this",39,7,13
clique; the ground near them seemed to hold my feet. The canopy of,39,2,13
"entwined trees held out shadow, the night whispered a pledge of",39,2,11
"protection, and an officious lamp flashed just one beam to show me an",39,6,13
"obscure, safe seat, and then vanished. Let me now briefly tell the",39,4,12
"reader all that, during the past dark fortnight, I have been silently",39,6,12
"gathering from Rumour, respecting the origin and the object of M.",39,2,11
"Emanuel’s departure. The tale is short, and not new: its alpha is",39,6,13
"Mammon, and its omega Interest.",39,3,5
THE HAPPY PAIR.,40,2,3
"The day succeeding this remarkable Midsummer night, proved no common",40,3,10
"day. I do not mean that it brought signs in heaven above, or portents",40,5,14
"on the earth beneath; nor do I allude to meteorological phenomena, to",40,5,12
"storm, flood, or whirlwind. On the contrary: the sun rose jocund, with",40,1,12
"a July face. Morning decked her beauty with rubies, and so filled her",40,4,13
"lap with roses, that they fell from her in showers, making her path",40,4,13
"blush: the Hours woke fresh as nymphs, and emptying on the early hills",40,3,13
"their dew-vials, they stepped out dismantled of vapour: shadowless,",40,4,10
"azure, and glorious, they led the sun’s steeds on a burning and",40,4,13
FAUBOURG CLOTILDE.,41,1,2
"Must I, ere I close, render some account of that Freedom and Renovation",41,4,13
which I won on the fête-night? Must I tell how I and the two stalwart,41,3,16
companions I brought home from the illuminated park bore the test of,41,3,12
intimate acquaintance?,41,4,2
I tried them the very next day. They had boasted their strength loudly,41,3,13
"when they reclaimed me from love and its bondage, but upon my demanding",41,4,13
"deeds, not words, some evidence of better comfort, some experience of a",41,1,12
"relieved life—Freedom excused himself, as for the present impoverished",41,1,10
and disabled to assist; and Renovation never spoke; he had died in the,41,6,13
FINIS.,42,0,1
Man cannot prophesy. Love is no oracle. Fear sometimes imagines a vain,42,7,12
thing. Those years of absence! How had I sickened over their,42,3,11
anticipation! The woe they must bring seemed certain as death. I knew,42,5,12
the nature of their course: I never had doubt how it would harrow as it,42,4,15
went. The juggernaut on his car towered there a grim load. Seeing him,42,4,13
"draw nigh, burying his broad wheels in the oppressed soil—I, the",42,2,12
prostrate votary—felt beforehand the annihilating craunch.,42,6,7
"Strange to say—strange, yet true, and owning many parallels in life’s",42,7,13
experience—that anticipatory craunch proved all—yes—nearly _all_ the,42,7,10
